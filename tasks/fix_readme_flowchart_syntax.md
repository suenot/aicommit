# Task: Fix Readme Flowchart Syntax

## User Request
The user provided a Mermaid syntax error from the flowchart in `readme.md` related to unquoted parentheses in node text.

## Reasoning & Plan

1.  **Analysis:** The error message `Parse error on line 34: ... Expecting 'SQE', ... got 'PS'` clearly indicates a syntax error where Mermaid encountered unexpected characters (likely the `(` from `(using refined prompt)`) inside node text.
2.  **Plan:** Modify the mermaid diagram in `readme.md` by enclosing the text content of the affected nodes (`O`, `K13`, `I3`) in double quotes (`"...")` to correctly handle the parentheses and other special characters.

## Checked Paths/Files
*   `readme.md`: Read, analyzed, and modified.

## Status
- [x] Identified Mermaid syntax error.
- [x] Corrected mermaid diagram in `readme.md` by quoting node text.
- [x] Created this task file.
